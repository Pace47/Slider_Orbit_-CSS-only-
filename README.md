# Slider_Orbit_-CSS-only-

This was a bit tricky for me.

The hard part was how to rotate all the images in a circle in such a way. It was made possible from the formula [(position-1)*(360/total_images)] which I learned from Lun Dev Code(thanks!).

The header file (Battle Awaits) was also bit tricky. I used ::after and stored my contents in 'data-' which made it easy for me to make it transparent.

Thank you for reading!!!
